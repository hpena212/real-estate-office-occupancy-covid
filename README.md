# Real Estate Market Insights: Office Occupancy & COVID Impact

**Best Insights Award – DataFest 2025**  
Savills-backed analysis of **2018–2024** office occupancy data across U.S. **tech markets** to inform client decisions on **where/whether/how** to locate offices post-COVID.

## About This Project

This repository contains the work my team and I presented at **DataFest 2025**, where we earned the *Best Insights Award*. The challenge was sponsored by **Savills**, a global real estate advisory firm, who provided office occupancy and market data spanning **2018–2024**. The task: uncover trends and microtrends that could inform Savills’ clients on **where, whether, and how to lease office space in a post-pandemic world**.

Our analysis focused on **U.S. tech markets**, which were heavily disrupted by COVID-19 and the shift to remote work. We set out to answer key questions:  
- Did businesses downsize or move as a result of remote work?  
- Which regions were most affected by long-term occupancy declines?  
- How do macro factors like **unemployment rates** interact with office attendance?  

### Key Findings
- **Occupancy vs. Unemployment:** We found a strong **negative relationship** — higher unemployment consistently meant lower office occupancy, and this pattern persisted well beyond the initial shock of the pandemic.  
- **Tech Market Case Studies:** In California (San Francisco, Los Angeles, South Bay), occupancy plateaued below **50% of pre-pandemic levels**, even after economic recovery — signaling a structural shift in office demand.  
- **Market Microtrends:** Heatmaps and boxplots revealed geographic disparities in recovery. While some markets stabilized, others continued to show volatility in space availability and rent pricing.  
- **Business Implications:** Our insights suggested companies should consider **downsizing, rotating teams, or adopting shared workspaces**, while landlords and advisors like Savills could reposition strategy around discounted rents and hybrid office models.  

This project blended **data engineering (cleaning, structuring), analytics (correlations, case studies), and visualization (time-series, heatmaps, boxplots)** to turn raw data into **client-ready recommendations** for a global firm.
